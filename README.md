# RobotCode

## Including the [Yahboom Tank Code](http://www.yahboom.net/xiazai/Raspberry%20Pi%20G1/Download/Yahboom_Tank_Code.zip) from [GitHub](https://github.com/YahboomTechnology/Raspberry-pi-G1-Tank/issues/1)

Removed the massive data from the OpenCV 03SVM project.

As we worked through the details of programming the tank, we realized that we don't have an adequate understanding
of PWM actually works. To address this, we are providing a [tutorial to explain our steps](PWM/README.md) and (we hope) a better
explanation.
